October 23, 2018: Demonstrated my sensor to Kristian. The code worked, but the address was not the desired one. After researching, I know how to change the address from 0x40 to 0x42 through Adafruit, by using pinout A0 and A1 (https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-hdc1008-temperature-and-humidity-sensor-breakout/pinouts). However, since Adafruit has discontinued this product, I had to buy the ones without those pinouts.I tried changing the code and even used 3rd party programs, but none worked.
The sensor is working perfectly fine under 0x40

October 21, 2018: Finished the Python code.

October 20, 2018: Started writing the code for the sensor. I tried both Python and C and had problems with both.

October 18, 2018: Started the Raspberry Pi Installation. For me the NOOBS didn't work, but flashing the Raspbian ISO file into the SD card worked.
